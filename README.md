autograder
==========

This collection of scripts implements an automatic grader system for *Linux* that can be used to grade programming assignments written in a variety of languages. It also includes scripts to interact with Canvas.

In short, the normal workflow is:

* *ag.py download*  will download the newest non-late student submissions from Canvas. If the submission. If the submitted file is a tar, tgz, tar.gz, or zip file, the file will be extracted into a subfolder.

* *ag-grade.py* is provided by the instructor and will grade each of the assignments. This script would typically make use of the autograde.py module. In the case of programming assignments, this script can compile, run, and examine the output of a computer program. It creates an AUTOGRADE.txt file which contains a report of the automatic grading process. The instructor would use this file to assist with grading and/or share the file with the submitter.

* *ag.py stats* will display general information about the submissions and the scores.

* *ag.py email* emails the autograder reports to students.


Getting started
==============

* This code requires Linux.
* If you are using Canvas, create a file named ".canvas-token" in your home directory that contains:

```
self.CANVAS_API="https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/"
self.CANVAS_TOKEN="token-generated-in-canvas"
```

The first line should be the URL for the Canvas API. For Michigan Tech, for example, this URL should be "https://mtu.instructure.com/api/v1". The second line should contain a token that you must generate in Canvas and will be a string of characters and numbers. To generate one, login to Canvas, go to "Settings" and click on the "New Access Token" button.

* Next, make a file named "autograde-config.json" in the folder where you want to accept submissions that contains the following:

```
{                                                 // REMOVE THESE COMMENTS!
    "courseName":"CS4461 Networks - Spring 2015", // name of course on Canvas
    "assignmentName":"HW5: HTTP server",          // name of assignment on Canvas
    "subdirName":"autograder",                    // subdirectory to place submissions in
    "domainName":"mtu.edu",                       // domain name to use for email messages
    "emailFrom":"user",                           // email address of sender
    "emailFromName":"Jane Doe",                   // name of sender
    "emailPassword":"password",                   // email password for sender
    "emailSmtp":"smtp.gmail.com",                 // smtp server
    "emailSmtpPort":"587"                         // smtp port
}
```

* Download canvas.py, autograder.py and ag.py onto your machine. If you want to install them in a single location, ensure that your PYTHONPATH and PATH environment variables includes the path where these files exist. Ensure that canvas.py and ag.py are executable.
* Put ag-grade.py in the same folder that contains "autograde-config.json".
* While in the same directory containing autograde-config.json and ag-grade.py:
    * Run "ag.py download" to download the newest non-late submissions.
    * Modify and then run "./ag-grade.py" to grade any submissions that were downloaded
    * Run "ag.py stats" to view results of the grading process
    * Run "ag.py email" to email the results to the students


Additional information
=====================

Submission download process
---------

If you run the "ag.py download" command repeatedly, it will only download the newest non-late submissions---but it will not download a submission again if the current downloaded copy is up-to-date. When it is necessary to download a newer submission to replace an old one, any existing AUTOGRADE.txt reports are discarded. You can also request to download a specific attempt of a specific user with "ag.py download username attempt#"

Locking a submission
-------------

Since the download script will always overwrite older submissions with newer, non-late submissions, sometimes it is useful to indicate that you do not want a submission to be overwritten when "ag.py download" is run. The "ag.py lock username" mechanism makes it possible to lock a particular submission. It can later be unlocked with "ag.py unlock username"

Grading submissions
--------------

A submission will only be graded if an AUTOGRADE.txt grade report is missing. If you only want to grade a specific submission(s), you can use "ag-grade.py username(s)".  If you want to force the grading to occur again on all submissions (for example, if the ag-grade.py script has been changed), you can run the "ag.py regrade" command to clear all AUTOGRADE.txt files for all users (or just specific users if usernames are provided).

A note about email
---------------

The *ag.py email* command will email autograder reports to students. It does not send the student a report if they have already received a copy of that report. Specifically, "ag-grade.py" will set a flag in the json metadata file for that submission indicating that an email has not been sent whenever a submission is autograded. As a result, you can download and email students repeatedly: Only new submissions will be downloaded and only the emails that need to get sent will get sent. You can run *ag.py emailCacheClear* if you want the system to assume that no students have been emailed reports previously.

If there are a group of students associated with a submission, the email will be sent to each student in the group.

If the Canvas login does not include an '@' symbol, then the domain name specified in autograde-config.json is appended to the end of the username.  This code has only been tested at MTU which uses Gmail. If you are using two-factor authentication with Google, you need to generate an 'application specific' password: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en




Other files
==========

*canvas.py* implements a python module to interface with Canvas using the Instructure Canvas API. Besides being a module used by ag.py, it can also be run directly from the command-line. It allows an instructor to see their Canvas courses, list students in a course, list assignments in a course, list assignments that have been submitted, and download submissions.

*autograde.py* implements a python module used by the ag-grade.py script.
