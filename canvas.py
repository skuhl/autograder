#
# self.CANVAS_API="https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/"
# self.CANVAS_TOKEN="token-generated-in-canvas"
#
# The first line should be the URL for the Canvas API. For Michigan
# Tech, for example, this URL should be
# "https://mtu.instructure.com/api/v1". The second line should contain
# a token that you must generate in Canvas and will be a string of
# characters and numbers. To generate one, login to Canvas, go to
# "Settings" and click on the "New Access Token" button.


# The canvas object will remember the courseId you use in the
# constructor and use that if you don't provide a courseId to the
# other functions that you call. Or, you can manually override the
# courseId in your calls to specific functions.
